<h1>Diana's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>These are my favorite movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>X-Men Saga</h3>
    <p>This one is entertaining, has a good story and you don't need to watch all of them to understand
    the storyline of a single movie. However, if you do watch them all, you'll get much more interested
    in the characters and you will understand little nuances that you may not catch if you only watch one.</p>
<h3>Freaky Friday</h3>
    <p>I've watch this one millions of times and I keep laughing at their jokes. It is very funny and has a nice message</p>
<h3>Pincess Movies</h3>
    <p>Although this is a "too girly" entry, I can't deny that I love Disney's princess movies. I would divide them in two categories:</p>
    <h4>Classics:</h4>
        <p>Snow White<br />
        Cinderella<br />
        Sleepy Beauty<br />
        Beauty and the Beast -the one I feel most identified with, from this category</p>
    <h4>Modern:</h4>
        <p>Brave<br />
        Frozen<br />
        The Princess and the Frog<br />
        Tangled -the one I feel most identified with, from this category</p>
<hr />

<h2>Other movies worth mentioning</h2>
    <p>While the below movies wouldn't necessarily be listed amongst my favourite movies,
    I definitely enjoyed them and I would happily re-watch them:</p>
<h3>Superheroe Movies</h3>
    <p>This is also a cliche, but I can't deny I love them. I would divide them in two categories:</p>
    <h4>Marvel:</h4>
        <p>Iron Man<br />
        Thor<br />
        Captain America<br />
        The Avengers</p>
    <h4>DC:</h4>
        <p>Superman<br />
        Batman -I love batman<br />
        Wonder Woman<br />
        Aquaman</p>
<h3>Step-Up</h3>
    <p>What can I say? I am a dancer and I love dance movies</p>
<h3>And now behaving like an adult:</h3>
    <p>Inception<br />
    Coda<br />
    Oppenheimer<br />
    Minority Report</p>
<p>If I keep thinking I could keep writing, but this is all I'm going to write for now.</p>
